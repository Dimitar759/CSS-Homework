            <p><b>Rottweilers</b> are large, muscular dogs that are known for their strength and loyalty. They are originally from Germany,
            where they were used as herding dogs and pulling carts. Today, they are popular family pets and working dogs.</p>

            <p>Like the mythical Greek hero Hercules, the Rottweiler is strong and true with a loving heart. Affectionately called
            Rotties or Rotts, the breed originated in Germany, where it was used to drive cattle and pull carts for farmers and
            butchers. That heritage is reflected in the Rottie&#180;s broad chest and heavily muscled body. When he moves, he displays
            strength and stamina, but when you look into his eyes you see warm, dark-brown pools reflecting a mellow, intelligent,
            alert, and fearless expression.</p>

            <p>A well-bred Rottweiler is calm and confident. He&#180;s typically aloof toward strangers, but never timid or fearful.
            Rottweilers exhibit a “wait-and-see” attitude when confronted with new people and situations. When these characteristics
            come together as they should, the Rottweiler is a natural guard dog with a mellow disposition who is successful not only
            in police, military, and customs work, but also as a family friend and protector. Rotties have a natural instinct to
            protect their families and can be ferocious in their defense. It&#180;s essential to channel their power and protectiveness
            by providing early socialization, firm, fair, consistent training and leadership, and a regular job to perform.
            </p>

            <p>When this doesn&#180;t happen, Rottweilers can become dangerous bullies rather than the companionable guardians they&#180;re meant
            to be. Rottweilers walk a fine line between protectiveness and aggressiveness. If they aren&#180;t carefully bred for a calm,
            intelligent temperament and properly socialized and trained, they can become overly protective.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p class = "history">According to the FCI Standard, the Rottweiler is considered to be one of the oldest surviving dog breeds. Its origin
                goes back to Roman times. These dogs were kept as herder or driving dogs. They marched over the Alps with the Roman
                legions, protecting the humans and driving their cattle. In the region of Rottweil, these dogs met and mixed with the
                native dogs in a natural crossing. The main task of the Rottweiler now became the driving and guarding of the herds of
                cattle and the defence of their masters and their property. This breed acquired its name from the old free city of
                Rottweil and was known as the &#34;<i>Rottweil butcher&#180;s dog</i>&#34;.</p>

                <p class = "history">The buildup to World War I saw a great demand for police dogs, which led to a revival of interest in the Rottweiler.
                During the First and Second World Wars, Rottweilers saw service in various roles, including as messenger, ambulance,
                draught, and guard dogs.   
                The Deutscher Rottweiler-Klub (<abbr title="Deutscher Rottweiler-Klub">DRK</abbr>,<i>German Rottweiler Club</i> ), the first Rottweiler club in Germany, was founded on 13
                January 1914, and followed by the creation of the Süddeutscher Rottweiler-Klub (<abbr title="South German Rottweiler Club">SDRK</abbr>, <i>South German Rottweiler Club</i>) on
                27 April 1915 and eventually became the IRK (International Rottweiler Club). The DRK counted around 500 Rottweilers, and
                the SDRK 3,000 Rottweilers. The goals of the two clubs were different. The DRK aimed to produce working dogs and did not
                emphasise the morphology of the Rottweiler.</p>

                <p class = "history">The various German Rottweiler Clubs amalgamated to form the Allgemeiner Deutscher Rottweiler Klub (ADRK, General German
                Rottweiler Club) in 1921. This was officially recorded in the register of clubs and associations at the district court
                of Stuttgart on 27 January 1924. The ADRK is recognised worldwide as the home club of the Rottweiler.
                
                In 1931, the Rottweiler was officially recognised by the American Kennel Club. In 1936, Rottweilers were exhibited
                in Britain at Crufts. In 1966, a separate register was opened for the breed. In fact, in the mid-1990s, the popularity
                of the Rottweiler reached an all-time high, as it was the most registered dog by the American Kennel Club. In 2017,
                the American Kennel Club ranked the Rottweiler as the <b>eighth-most popular purebred dog</b> in the United States.</p>

                <h3>Temperament</h3>

                <p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Kennel_Club" target="_blank">American Kennel Club&#180;s</a> "Official Standard of the Rottweiler," the Rottweiler's temperament should be:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <q>a calm, confident and courageous dog with a self-assured aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and
                    indiscriminate friendships. A Rottweiler is self-confident and responds quietly and with a wait-and-see attitude to
                    influences in its environment. It has an inherent desire to protect home and family, and is an intelligent dog of
                    extreme hardness and adaptability with a strong willingness to work, making them especially suited as a companion,
                    guardian and general all-purpose dog.</q>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Rottweilers are a powerful breed with well-developed genetic herding and guarding instincts. Potentially dangerous
                    behaviour in Rottweilers usually results from irresponsible ownership, abuse, neglect, or lack of socialisation and
                    training. However, the exceptional strength of the Rottweiler is an additional risk factor not to be neglected. It is
                    for this reason that breed experts declare that formal training and extensive socialisation are essential for all
                    Rottweilers. According to the <abbr title="American Kennel Club">AKC</abbr>, Rottweilers love their owners and may behave in a clownish manner toward family and friends, but they are also protective of their territory and do not welcome strangers until properly introduced. Obedience training and socialization are required.
